# keywordmanager
KeyWordManager is a lightweight, browser-based application for managing keywords (tags) and their associated entries (like IDs, notes, chapters, diary entries, or file references). It's built entirely within a single HTML file using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, requiring no installation or external dependencies beyond a modern web browser.
